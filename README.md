Completed a hands-on project on sentiment analysis using logistic regression to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative. Utilized NLTK for text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction, and Scikit-Learn for model training and evaluation. Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning and assessed accuracy using standard classification metrics.
